Marcia brought years of experience for interior decorating into the fold by working for both herself (self employment) and other companies. She passed that knowledge onto both of her daughters, Missy and Lacy. While Lacy was getting a degree in business, Missy was getting certified as an Interior Decorator (just like her mom). By combining all three, MML Design was born (the actual order of MML is Marcia, Missy, Lacy). Marcia and Missy spent a decade traveling to homes to help others \u0026ldquo;beautify\u0026rdquo; their spaces while doing business as Decorating Den Interiors. Marcia retired in 2019 in Tucson, AZ. In 2021 the whole family moved to finally be in the same location, Clarksville, TN. Here we decided to rebuild from scratch.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about/","section":"MML Design, LLC","summary":"(in pictured order: Missy, Marcia, and Lacy Naughton) MMLDesign was founded by Marcia Naughton in 2009.","title":"MML Design, LLC"},{"content":"Nuno\u0026rsquo;s awesome dummy bio.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/authors/missy/","section":"Authors Taxonomy Listing Example","summary":"Nuno\u0026rsquo;s awesome dummy bio.","title":"Nuno Coração"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
